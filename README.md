# dStream

> **Ownerless, Peer-to-Peer, Privacy-Centric Live Streaming.**

dStream is a decentralized streaming protocol that solves deplatforming, platform fees, and reliance on platforms themselves by combining direct cryptocurrency monetization (100% private, with no middleman), a **P2P network**, and **Nostr identity** (your unique streamer keys).

---

## Vision

Platforms like Twitch and YouTube own your audience. They can de-platform you, shadow-ban you, and take a 50% cut of your revenue. **dStream is built different.**

- **No Central Server:** Video segments are distributed via P2P relaying, dramatically reducing infrastructure costs.
- **Permanent Metadata:** Your stream name, bio, and status are stored on the Nostr network.
- **True Privacy:** Payments happen over Monero (XMR), ensuring no one knows who tipped whom.

---

## Key Features

- **P2P HLS Streaming**: High-definition video delivery that scales with your audience.
- **Decentralized Discovery**: Uses NIP-34 style Nostr events for stream announcements.
- **Monero Staking & Tipping**: Support creators directly with XMR without any middleman.
- **WHIP/WHEP Native**: Compatible with professional OBS setups and browser-based broadcasting.
- **Trustless Escrow**: Built-in anti-leeching mechanisms using cryptographic stakes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons
- **Video Stack**: MediaMTX, HLS.js, [P2P-Media-Loader](https://github.com/Novage/p2p-media-loader)
- **Networking**: Nostr (`nostr-tools`), WebRTC (WHIP/WHEP)
- **Economy**: Monero (XMR)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker & Docker Compose

## Trustless Staking

dStream implements a unique **Escrow/Staking** flow using Monero subaddresses. Viewers provide a small "anti-leech" stake to verify their humanity, which can be released or claimed based on stream integrity. No smart contracts required—just pure peer-to-peer verification.
